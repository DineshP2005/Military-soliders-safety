Project Description:
This project leverages YOLO (You Only Look Once), a real-time object detection algorithm, and Computer Vision techniques to enhance military surveillance and soldier safety. The system is designed to detect weapons (e.g., guns, knives) and identify suspicious or threatening activity in real-time video feeds, helping in proactive threat response and defense operations.

Using OpenCV and Python, the system processes live or recorded footage from military zones or security checkpoints. A custom-trained YOLO model identifies weapons or intruders, and Streamlit is used to create an interactive dashboard for visualizing alerts, analytics, and camera feeds. This project contributes to defense and military domains by improving battlefield intelligence and reducing risk to personnel.

Key Features:
Real-time weapon detection using YOLOv5/v8.

Integration with live camera feeds using OpenCV.

Streamlit dashboard for user interaction and live monitoring.

Alert system for automatic threat detection and reporting.

Potential for deployment in border security, combat zones, or strategic military areas.

Skills and Technologies Used:
Python: Core language for development.

YOLO (You Only Look Once): Fast object detection framework.

Computer Vision & OpenCV: For video processing and frame analysis.

Streamlit: To build the interactive web app dashboard.

Machine Learning: Custom training of object detection models.

Domain Knowledge: Military surveillance, threat detection, and defense systems.

Skills Takeaway:
Hands-on experience with object detection and tracking using deep learning.

Proficiency in integrating ML models into real-time applications.

Building end-to-end computer vision systems for critical use cases.

Understanding of military and defense domain requirements in AI.

Experience with deployment tools like Streamlit for creating interactive interfaces.
